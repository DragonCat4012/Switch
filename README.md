# Switch
Binary Lamp Switch Game - Crewate Binary Numbers (from 0 to 127) using Lamps :3
With each iteration your time becomes less :3 yay :3 Every ten seconds the time gets less unless you jsut have 10s uwu

Since i started adding mobile support some things can be broken, like onClick Sensor things...
Otherwise naviagtion is possible ith Arrow Keys, ESC, Enter/SpaceBar and ofc just clicking on things. 
The options Menu content Box is kinda weird, so just try clicking on differnet places a few times uwu

Goal: Find the impossible Number ;3

Note: Tutorial is currently for the old UI, Textfields have been moved
